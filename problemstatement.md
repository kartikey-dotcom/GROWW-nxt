# Problem Statement: Mutual Fund FAQ Assistant (Facts-Only Q&A)

## Overview

The objective of this project is to build a **facts-only FAQ assistant** for mutual fund schemes, using **Groww** as the reference product context. The assistant will answer objective, verifiable queries related to mutual funds by retrieving information exclusively from official public sources, such as Asset Management Company (AMC) websites, AMFI, and SEBI.

The system must strictly avoid providing investment advice, opinions, or recommendations. Every response must include a single, clear source link and adhere to defined constraints around clarity, accuracy, and compliance.

## Objective

Design and implement a lightweight **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**-based assistant that:
1. **Answers factual queries** about mutual fund schemes.
2. **Uses a curated corpus** of official documents.
3. **Provides concise, source-backed responses**.

## Target Users

*   **Retail investors** comparing mutual fund schemes.
*   **Customer support and content teams** handling repetitive mutual fund queries.

    *   https://groww.in/mutual-funds/hdfc-small-cap-fund-direct-growth
    *   https://groww.in/etfs/hdfc-silver-etf

*   Collect 15–25 official public URLs, including:
    *   Scheme factsheets

### 2. FAQ Assistant Requirements
The assistant must:
*   **Answer facts-only queries**, such as:
    *   Expense ratio of a scheme
    *   Exit load details
    *   Minimum SIP amount
    *   ELSS lock-in period
    *   Riskometer classification
    *   Benchmark index
    *   Fund management data (e.g., fund manager name, tenure, and credentials)
    *   Process to download statements or capital gains reports
*   **Ensure compliance rules in responses**:
    *   Each response is limited to a maximum of **3 sentences**.
    *   Each response includes **exactly one** citation link.
    *   Each response includes a footer: `Last updated from sources: <date>`.

### 3. Refusal Handling
The assistant must refuse non-factual or advisory queries, such as:
*   *“Should I invest in this fund?”*
*   *“Which fund is better?”*

Refusal responses should:
*   Be polite and clearly worded.
*   Reinforce the facts-only limitation.
*   Provide a relevant educational link (e.g., AMFI or SEBI resource).

### 4. User Interface (Minimal)
The solution should include a simple interface with:
*   A welcome message
*   Three example questions
*   A visible disclaimer: `Facts-only. No investment advice.`
